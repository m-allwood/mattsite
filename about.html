        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <p>This site largely a place where I (publcly) practice making applications. I use what I currently know of Javascript and cloud services, and I am regularly trying to learn more.</p>
        <p>The projects are typically attempts to do things I want practice doing, but also need to be actually useful. Having no QA, I rely upon my friends to test and so will prioritize things they will use</p>
